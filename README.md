# Telegram Web Z

This project won the first prize ðŸ¥‡ at [Telegram Lightweight Client Contest](https://contest.com/javascript-web-3) and now is an official Telegram client available to anyone at [web.telegram.org/z](https://web.telegram.org/z).

According to the original contest rules, it has nearly zero dependencies and is fully based on its own [Teact](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt/tree/master/src/lib/teact) framework (which re-implements React paradigm). It also uses a custom version of [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs) as an MTProto implementation.

The project incorporates lots of technologically advanced features, modern Web APIs and techniques: WebSockets, Web Workers and WebAssembly, multi-level caching and PWA, voice recording and media streaming, cryptography and raw binary data operations, optimistic and progressive interfaces, complicated CSS/Canvas/SVG animations, reactive data streams, and so much more.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback and contribute.
